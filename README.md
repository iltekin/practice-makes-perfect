# My Beginner iOS Apps
### Practice makes perfect.

Hi there!

My name is Sezer and I'm the one who is always excited even running an app that prints "hello, world!"

These are my begginner apps while I learned iOS programming.<br/>After 6 years of PHP, Swift is like a brand new car for me.

Spoiler:
#### I will be the iOS Developer who everyone knows one day.
